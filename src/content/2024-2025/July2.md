###  Personal Project Planning

I want you all to make a person project. It has to be something built outside of class that you would be proud of and put on your resume.
Over the summer I want you all to plan this project.
We have 6 club meeting. 
I have come up with a 6-step plan we will be going though.
We are going to cover this during the club meeting, but you **MUST** work on this outside of these meeting to keep up. 
This is to get them excited and motivated to build your personal project later. Here is my ideas so
far please add to it and make it take up the six club meetings.

1. **COMPLETE** Idea (What personal problem does it solve? )
2. **COMPLETE** Feature list and Rough wireframe
3. High Resolution wireframe / Integrative demo
4. Pick Tech Stack and UML for Database
5. Project Roadmap, Environment Setup, and Discovery 

#### Personal Project Planning Step 3

Where comes the fun part building your high resolution wireframe.
Use / Build your style guide (colors and fonts).
Start by building out core UI components. 

- Buttons
- Forms
- Header
- Nav
- Footer

Then move on to building each page of your site. 
Make sure each page on your site: 

- Follows style guide and has consistent padding/margins. 
- Make sure the page is dynamic (Works with mobile). 
- The design covers all features
  - Example: If you have the feature to login. Well show in the header if your logged it. 
  - Example: If you want to be able to delete something. Add a delete button. 

By just looking at your wireframe anyone should be able to see all features of your app. 

Example Wireframe: https://www.figma.com/design/kvwpcCw1ymmAvHKgOKNrza/CSD-Club-Website-High-Fidelity-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=aFqummcRCuIrmx41-1
