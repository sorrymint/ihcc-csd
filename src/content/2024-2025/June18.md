### 2025-2026 Club Schedule

We need to start planning the 2025-2026 Club Schedule.
We want to meet the first, second, and third Wednesday on each month.
We also need to pick dates for club events (fall picnic and game nights).
We also need ideas for other club events (low budget).
Club Leadership will get together to build this schedule.
The finalized schedule will be sent to marketing.

Has there been any update on planning hte 2025-2026 Club Schedule?

### Personal Project Planning

I want you all to make a person project. It has to be something built outside of class that you would be proud of and
put on your resume.
Over the summer I want you all to plan this project.
We have 6 club meeting.
I have come up with a 6-step plan we will be going though.
We are going to cover this during the club meeting, but you **MUST** work on this outside of these meeting to keep up.
This is to get them excited and motivated to build your personal project later. Here is my ideas so
far please add to it and make it take up the six club meetings.

1. **COMPLETE** Idea (What personal problem does it solve? )
2. Feature list and Rough wireframe
3. High Resolution wireframe / Integrative demo
4. Pick Tech Stack
5. UML for Database
6. Project Roadmap, Environment Setup, and Discovery

#### Personal Project Planning Step 2

Feature List:

This step is easy.
You need to think about all the features you want your app to have.
Let's use a To-Do list as an example.

1. User to see tasks
2. User be able to Perform CRUD on tasks.
3. Task data to have persistence (Database).
4. The app to be hosted
5. Each user have their own todo list.
6. Stretch goal a "+" plan with extra features (shared lists).

You don't need to go into deep detail into the technical aspect on how you will build each feature.
Just know you can always increase the scope of the project later.
Go into detail of each feature and build a user story for each.

Example:

- Task data to have persistence (Database).
    - User logs into the app. The user adds a new task to the To-do list. User leaves app. User logs back into the app
      and the task are still present.

Rough Wireframe:

On pin and paper sketch out what you think the app should look like.
Focus on the site routing and site layout.
Don't focus on color, fonts, or styling.
Make sure each feature outlined in the step before is represented.
Do not speed a long time on the rough sketch we will improve on it next time.
