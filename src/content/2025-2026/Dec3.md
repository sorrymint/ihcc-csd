# Meeting Notes

## Outline

### Open Discussion About Spring Events

I know it's cold outside and this term is very busy.
This term the club usually is pretty quiet.
I would like to see more events this spring term.
I want to hear from you what events you would like to see.
This club is student-run and operated if you want to see something happen, you have to be involved.

### Gaming Tournament Fundraiser

We had great success raising money for Byte Jam.
Thank you everyone who helped out.
I really enjoyed seeing you all have a gaming tournament.
I would like for us to host another one this winter term.

We also need to pick a game.
