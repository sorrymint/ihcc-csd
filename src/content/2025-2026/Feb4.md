# Meeting Notes

## Outline

### Marketing

We need more students in our program.
IHCC is, let’s just say... unmotivated to advertise your program.
So fine, I will do it myself.
We have a Facebook and an Instagram account we need students to help us grow it.
We need students to write, script, and shot videos and posts to promote our program.
Come up with ideas and send them to **NEW** club leadership.
We will be giving limited access to the accounts to club leadership.

> Person from Marketing will speak after this intro
