# Meeting Notes

## Outline



### DEMO

We go to a lot of career fairs.
We need something to take and show off at these fairs.
Auto can show off cars.
Welding can show off machines.
What do we show????
Come up with something impressive to show off. 

Please follow the guidelines below: 

- The "3-Second Rule"
- Interactive **NOT** passive
- "Vibes" would a non-technical person be impressed? or know what it is?
- Hardware
  - Hardware is great, but we should have to buy it. 
- "Prototype" it doesn't have to be production ready but has to work reliably.
