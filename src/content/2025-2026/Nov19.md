We had great success raising money for Byte Jam.

We are hosting another session for 8th graders on November 21st.
I need 3–4 people to come to help run the session.

Please meet me on the 24th at 9:30am in ATC224 (Right across from room 200).
Jarrett will be hosting this, so please reach out to him.

### Freelance Web Development

I have been hearing rumors that the interactive media club is going out an getting a freelance web development jobs.
THAT SHOULD BE YOU.
Go out into our community and find a business that needs a website.
I think you would have better luck with a smaller business.
See a restaurant without a website, talk to them and ask if they want one. 
Don't be afraid to work for little pay. 
You are getting paid by expense. 

1. Find your target business.
2. Talk to them.
3. Get a list of requirements and needs.
     - Be resealable to your ability
4. Work out web hosting
5. GET IT SHIPPED
6. Add the experience to your resume and/or portfolio.

### GO SEE THE TUTORS

THEY ARE FREE.
If you are struggling on a project.
If you need a concept reexplained to you.
Or if you just want a study buddy, THEN GO SEE THE TUTORS.
