### First Game night

Let's pick a date and game.
Any week day (I don't recommend Thursday) during Fall term.
Any game that is local co-op.
It is recommended the game is cheap/free and is easy to run on most computers.

### Club Website

A group of students have been working on the club Website. 
They started from scratch this summer and build something really cool. 
This proofs that a group of students from the club can go and build cool things.
If you have an idea for a project get a group of students together, and we can make it ship. 

### Pizza Ranch

There is a sign-up form.
If you want to do ByteJam we need money.
The worse this does the more fundraisers we will have to do. 
I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE TO GO DOOR SELLING SOMETHING.
So lets make this fund-raiser successful.
